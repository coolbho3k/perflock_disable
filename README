SetCPU perflock disabler driver

This driver can disable the "perflock" driver on HTC Android phones
running stock kernels. It works by copying shellcode that disables
a function vital to perflock to a user specified-memory address.

Usage: insmod perflock_disable.ko perflock_notifier_call_addr=X

Where X is the address of perflock_notifier_call.
